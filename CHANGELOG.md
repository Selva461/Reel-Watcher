# Reel Shelf for Android: changes

Every change raises `versionCode` (+1) and `versionName` in `android/app-shell/app/build.gradle` and adds a
section here; the APK workflow publishes release `v<versionName>` with this section as its notes, and points
`apk-latest` at it. Builds signed with the stable key (GitHub secrets `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` and
`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`) install as updates over the previous version.

## 1.0.0
- First update-safe build: signed with the app's own stable key, so later versions install over it.
  (Copies installed before 1.0.0 were signed with a temporary key: uninstall that once, then install 1.0.0.)
- Instagram export: if Meta sends a web page instead of the ZIP, the download opens in Chrome; choose the ZIP in Add.
- Jobs you start (Start, screenshots, online check, export download) keep running after you leave the app,
  with a notification showing progress and a Stop button. Nothing starts by itself.
- Overnight run (Start tab): AI model, notes for every reel, new screenshots, title check, JSON backup, in one go.
- Meta AI is only used when you tap Ask Meta AI (the Shelf suggestion is off unless switched on in Settings).
- Saved-reels import: big/ZIP64 exports, a "check now" reminder, Chrome fallback.
